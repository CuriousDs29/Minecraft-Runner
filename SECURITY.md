## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.
If you have to report any bugs or vulnerability please send them to this gmail
Devavrata29@gmail.com
Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc. Send the email through gmail to devarata29@gmail.com then send if there is any 
vulnerablilty and I will fix it in a later update. But if it is in a older version not supported anymore
then I wouldn't help because it is a old issue in the game. I update the game everyday even on  weekend.
Each version fixes a bug and removes some features and adds new features.
